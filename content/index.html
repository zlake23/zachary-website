</h2>
<p>
I enjoy learning to code because it challenges the way I think and decipher the world around me. Coding provides me with a way to explore the world
of computers and software and figure out the logic and reason for why they function the way they do. My motivation to learn and become more skilled as a programmer stems from the vast number of 
possibilities that exist within the realm of technology and my desire to play a role in furthering technology for the benefit of future generations.
