My decision to transition to programming as a career path was one that took its time in coming. The journey started towards the tail end of when I was deciding what to do about my current job prospects. I had been teaching for the past three years in a foreign country and the return home left me with decisions to make in terms of rebuilding connections and deciding the next chapter of my life.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
Over the next several months,  I only dabbled with the thought of coding as  a possible career move. I utilized resources recommended by my brother such as TeamTreeHouse and Codecademy. However, I found it difficult to devote much time toward learning and only picked up a few things in HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
The next step that took me closer to my decision was the move to San Francisco. I had been on the fence about leaving the town that was so familiar and comfortable and moving to the bay area to seek out other career opportunities. I finally made the plunge during the summer of 2018 and it's been quite the journey. I've been working at a local university in an office job, doing the 9 to 5 to afford the new living costs of the bigger city. What sealed my decision to move toward coding as a new career was the app, Career Karma. I joined the community and took part in their 21 Day Challenge. Through this challenge I learned more about coding bootcamps and discovered a community of people who were in similar positions trying to break into the technology industry, all while picking up on various resources to help me understand what it would take to make this opportunity a reality.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
Fast forward to 2020 - I've been learning code more seriously through FreeCodeCamp since the summer of 2019. I am now enrolled in KickStart Coding as a way to accelerate my learning and dive deeper into the programming culture (more on that adventure in another post). It is daunting but also exciting to think of all the possibilities that exist in this new field. While I am still only in the first initial steps, the outlook is positive as I continue to press forward.

I finally made the plunge and enrolled in one of the multitude of coding bootcamps!
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
July - September 2019 - I discovered KickStart Coding after having spent a few months using the self-taught approach to learn how to code. On my own, I had been advancing through lessons on FreeCodeCamp and felt that I was making decent headway. However, I stalled on my progress and began to feel the lack of motivation creeping in. 
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
Researching the different bootcamps in the San Francisco bay area was daunting. The price tags were a hard pill to swallow even with the offers of no-tuition-paid-until-you-get-a-job. On top of that, the class schedules weren't always a good fit with my current work schedule, even when they were part time in the evenings. What finally did it was a random advertisement for KickStart Coding and it felt like the doorway to an opportunity opened up.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
October 2019 - KickStart was exactly the bootcamp I was looking for. Its pricepoint was unmatched by the other bootcamps I had researched, and the program length was only four months while offering a curriculum that would teach both front-end and back-end programming. After reading up on their website, I knew this was the chance I had been hoping for. I applied, made it through the initial interview process and then the email that made it a reality:
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
I had been accepted! The next few months were spent working on prework materials in advance of the first day of class. As each month ticked by on the calendar, I was getting closer to beginning my journey to accomplish my career goal.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
March 2020 - I have now attended my first week of class and already I feel that the bootcamp has delivered on its promise. The course material that I've studied has only served to reinforce my desire to learn and do what is necessary to transition into software programming. 
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
I'm looking forward to the next four months to see just how much I am able to learn and practice on the next step of my journey.
